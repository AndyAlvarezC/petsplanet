    <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.</p>

    <p>Several types of products are exempt from being returned. Perishable products, such as food, flowers, newspapers, or magazines cannot be returned. We also do not accept products that are intimate or sanitary, hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases.</p>

        <li>Gift cards</li>
        <li>Downloadable software products</li>
        <li>Some health and personal care items</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase. Do not return your purchase to the manufacturer.</p>

    <p>There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted: (if applicable)</p>
    <ul>

    <h2>Refunds (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received the returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.</p>
    <p>If approved, your refund will be processed and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original payment method within a certain amount of days.</p>

    <h2>Late or missing refunds (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.</p>
    <p>Then, contact your credit card company. It may take some time before your refund is officially posted.</p>
    <p>Next, contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is reflected.</p>
    <p>If you’ve done all of this and still have not received your refund, please contact us at petsplanethelp@gmail.com.</p>
